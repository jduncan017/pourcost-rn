Below is a clean four-tier lineup (Free → Lite → Pro → Enterprise) with 5–6 carefully-chosen features per tier. I optimized for:
• Founder bandwidth (solo dev, low COGS)
• Clear upgrade path (each tier unlocks an obvious “next pain-killer”)
• AI cost control (heavy AI only in Pro/Enterprise)
• Investor story (easy to explain in the deck)

⸻

4 Weekend Reminder Emails (“Time to do your inventory”)
